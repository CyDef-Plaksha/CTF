# Alfred's Toy

*This problem is created by Arbaaz Shafiq*

Alfred has a very special toy that he inherited from his Grandfather. The toy is a small voicebox that plays a fun little sound every time it's used.

Alfred's Grandfather, a WWII Veteran, has now passed away, and Alfred want's to understand what the toy does. His mom thinks it's some kind of message.

Can you help Alfred figure out what message his grandfather is trying to say?

The toy's output is present in `beep.wav`.

Figure out what it means, and submit that as your flag.
