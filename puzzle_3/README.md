Joseph, a French astronomer, has uncovered a file in an ancient French computer system. He is very surprised at this, but the file appears to be altered in some way. No matter what Joseph does, the file does not open! He has tried many methods and techniques, but most programs tell him that the file is irrevocably corrupted. However, in his attempts, he has deduced that the file is a "Portable Network Graphics (PNG)" image file.

Can you help Joseph open the file? Fix the file based on it's type. The file is given in `ancientfile.png`.

The contents of the file is the flag.
