# Solution to "Pentimento"

The solution to this problem is rather trivial.

The file given, `pentimento.svg` is an SVG file with many "layers" or paths on top of each other. Opening this file in an SVG Editor, like "Inkscape", will immediately present you with some figures hidden behind other figures.

The answer was the figures that were hidden. These happened to be the code **"5x74eD"**. The easiest way to the problem was to delete the shapes that were obstructing the answer.

FLAG: **`5x74eD`**
