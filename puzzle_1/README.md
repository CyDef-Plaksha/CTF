# Pentimento

*This problem is created by Pranjal Rastogi*

Satvik is a budding vector art design who works from home. Unfortunately, when Satvik was editing his latest project, his cat, Melanie, ran over his keyboard, as cats do. Melanie's additions to Satvik's design do not bode well with the client.

The file `pentimento.svg` is a vector file (SVG) that contains Satvik's design after his cat ran over the keyboard. Figure out what Satvik's original, uncovered, design was!

The original design is the flag which is the solution to this problem.

Submit the flag as soon as you get it.
