# Capture-The-Flag puzzles

Welcome to the first-ever CyDef Capture-The-Flag event!

All the puzzles for the CTF are present in this repository (set of code).

*It is okay if you don't get all the answers! You win if you submit the **most** puzzles in the **least** time, using as little hints as possible.*

## Doing the puzzles!

You can download the puzzles and their files by clicking the Large green button on the Top Right. If you have worked with GitHub before, you can also clone this repository.

## Submitting!

You can submit the puzzles by using this (https://forms.office.com/r/PqDycfnTx0)[Microsoft Form]. Please submit using a valid Plaksha ID that is registered in the event.

## Hints

For hints, please ask the CyDef members at any point in time. 

**Each puzzle has a maximum of 3 hints**. The more hints you take, the more points get docked from your final score.
